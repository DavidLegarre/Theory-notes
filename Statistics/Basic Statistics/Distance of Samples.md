## Straight-line distance

```ad-summary 
title:Defintion 
Let the point $P=(x_{1},x_{2})$ then the distance from $P$ to the origin $O=(0,0)$ is:
$$
d(O,P)=\sqrt{x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}}
$$
```

```ad-summary 
title:Defintion
For a point with $p$ coordinates (variables) the straight-line distance from $P$ to $O$ is:
$$
d(O,P)=\sqrt{x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+\dots+x_{p}^{2}}
$$
```

Because this is the equation of a hypersphere (a circle if $p=2$), points equidistant from  the origin lie on a hypersphere.

```ad-summary 
title:Defintion 
The straight-line distance between two arbitrary points $P$ and $Q$ with coordinates $P=(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{p})$ and $Q=(y_{1},y_{2},\ldots,y_{p})$ is given by:
$$
d(P,Q)=\sqrt{(x_{1}-y_{1})^{2}+(x_{2}-y_{2})^{2}+\dots+(x_{p}-y_{p})^{2}}
$$
```
