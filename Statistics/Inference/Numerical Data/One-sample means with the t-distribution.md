title:Defintion 
The sample mean tends to follow a normal distribution centered at the population mean, $\mu$, when certain conditions are met.

When we collect a sufficiently large sample of $n$ independent observations from a population with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ will be nearly normal with

* Mean = $\mu$
* Standard Error (SE) = $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
