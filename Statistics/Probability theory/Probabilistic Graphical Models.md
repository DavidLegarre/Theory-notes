# Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM)
By using [[Graph|graphs]] we can encode a  high-dimensional probability distribution, and it allows for sparse parameterization. So that we can easily infer the [[Probability|probabilities]] of our model.

There are different kind of networks used:
* [[Bayesian Network]]
* [[Markov Networks]]

The set of algorithms:
* [[Belief propagation]]
* [[Inference in HMMs]]
* [[Junction Tree]]
* [[Variable Elimination (algorithm)]]
