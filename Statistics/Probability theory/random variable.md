# Random variable
```ad-summary 
title:Defintion 

A **random variable** $X$ is a measurable function $X:\Omega\to E$ from a set of possible outcomes $\Omega$ to a measurable space $E$. 

The probability that $X$ takes on a valuable in a measurable set $S\subseteq E$ is written as:
$$
P(X\in S)=P(\{\omega\in\Omega|X(\omega)\in S\})
$$
```
