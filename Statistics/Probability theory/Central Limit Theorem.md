```ad-summary 
title:Defintion 
In [[Probability Theory]] the **central limit theorem (CLT)** establishes 
that, in many situations, for indetically distributed independent samples, 
the standardized sample mean tends towards the standard normal distribution even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed

If we sample from a population using a sufficiently large sample size, the **mean of the samples** (also known as the sample population) will be normally distributed (assuming true random sampling). This is true **regardless** of the distribution of the original population. 

## Success-failure condition

```ad-summary 
title:Defintion 
We will say that a sample is sufficiently large when $n \mu\geq10$ and 
$n(1-\mu)\geq10$
