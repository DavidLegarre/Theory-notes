title:Definition

In [[Probability]] a **probability mass function** is a function that gives the probability that a discrete [[Random variables|random variable]] is exactly equal to some value.
```

Formal definition:

**PMF** is the probability distribution of a discrete random variable, and provides the possible values and their associated probabilities. It is the function $p:\mathbb{R}\to [0,1]$ defined by:
$$
p_X(x)=P(X=x)
$$
for $-\infty<x<\infty$.

It must hold that $\underset{x}{\Sigma}p_{X}(x)=1$ and $p_{X}(x)\geq 0$
