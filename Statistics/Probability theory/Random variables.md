A random variable, often noted $X$, is a function that maps every element in a sample space toa  real line

# [[Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)]]

```ad-summary 
title:Definition

The cumulative distribution function $F$, which is monotonically non-decreasing and is such that $\lim_{x\to-\infty} F(x)=0$ and $\lim_{x\to+\infty} F(x)=1$, is defined as:

$$
F(x)=P(X\leq x)
$$
```

We have that 
$$
P(a<X\leq B)=F(b)-F(a)
$$
# [[Probability Density Function (PDF)]] 

```ad-summary 
title:Definition

The probability density function $f$ is the probability that $X$ takes on  values between two adjacent realizations of the random variable
```

# Relationship between PDF and CDF

These are the important properties to know in the discrete $(D)$ and continuous $(C)$ cases:
