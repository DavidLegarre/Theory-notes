## Methods for data sampling

* **Simple random sampling**: Randomly select samples from the whole population
* **Stratified sampling**: Subsets of the data sets or population are created based on a common factor
* **Cluster Sampling**: The population is divided based on a defined factor into clusters, then select the entire clusters as samples.

* **Multistage sampling**: A more complicated form of cluster sampling, this method also involves dividing the larger population into a number of clusters. Second-stage clusters are then broken out based on a secondary factor, and those clusters are then sampled and analyzed. This staging could continue as multiple subsets are identified and analyzed.

## Non-probability data sampling methods

* **Convenience sampling**: Data is collected from an easily accessible and available group.
* **Consecutive sampling**: Data is collected from every subject that meets the criteria until the predetermined sample size is met.
* **Purposive or judgmental sampling**: The researcher selects the data to sample based on predefined criteria.
* **Quota sampling**: The researcher ensures equal representation withing the sample for all subgroups in the data set or population.
