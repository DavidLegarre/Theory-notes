# Transmitted Power
We define Transmitted Power:
![[Pasted image 20220425231003.png]]
$$Pt(dBm)=10\log10(Pt[mW])$$
# Path-loss
![[Pasted image 20220425231236.png]]
In relation with distance:
$$Pl[dB]=L1_m[dB]+10y(f,environment)\log10(d)[dB]$$
Where $L1_m$ represents the path-loss at $1$ meter.
# Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR)
$$SNR[dB]=Pr[dBm]-\text{Noise Power}[dBm]$$
