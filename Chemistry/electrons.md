# Electrons
The positive charges in the nucleus of an atom are neutralized, or counterbalanced, by negatively charged electrons, which are located in regions called **orbitals** that lie at varying distances around the nucleus. Atoms with the same number of protons and electrons are electrically neutral (that is, they have no net charge, and are therefore known as **neutral atoms**). 

Electrons are maintained in their orbitals by their attraction to the positively charged nucleus. Sometimes other forces overcome this attraction, and an atom loses one or more electrons. In other cases, atoms gain additional electrons.

An atom having more protons than electrons has a net positive charge and is called a **cation**. For example:
$$
\ce{Na->Na+}
$$
When $\ce{Na}$ loses an electron it becomes a sodium ion ($\ce{Na+}$), with a charge of $+1$. If otherwise it gains an electron it ends up with a  charge of -1 and it's called an **anion**
$$
\ce{Cl->Cl-}
$$
## Electrons determine the chemical behavior of atoms
The key to the chemical behavior of an atom lies in the number and arrangement of its electrons in their orbitals. The Bohr model of the atom shows individual electrons as following distinct circular orbits around a central nucleus.

**An orbital** is defined as the area around a nucleus where an electron is most likely to be found. These orbitals represent probability distributions for electrons.

## Atoms contain discrete energy levels
Because electrons are attracted to the positively charged nucleus, it takes work to keep them in their orbitals. Electrons have potential energy that is related to their position. To oppose the attraction of the nucleus and move the electron to a more distant orbital requires an input of energy, which results in an electron with greater potential energy. Moving an electron closer to the nucleus has the opposite effect: Energy is released, usually as radiant energy (heat or light), and the electron ends up with less potential energy.

These discrete energy levels correspond to quanta, which means specific amount of energy. Because the amount of energy an electron possesses is related to its distance from the nucleus, electrons that are the same distance from the nucleus have the same energy, even if they occupy different orbitals. Such electrons are said to occupy the same energy level. 
These energy levels are denoted with letters $K,L,M$ and so on.
