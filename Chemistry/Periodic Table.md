The elements exhibit a pattern of chemical properties that repeats itself in groups of eight. This periodically repeating pattern lent the table its name: the periodic table of the elements.

This periodicity is based on the interactions of the electrons in the outermost energy level of the different elements. These electrons are called **valence electrons**. The chemical behavior of an element reflects how many of the eight positions are filled. 

Elements possessing all eight electrons in their outer energy level are *inert*, or nonreactive. These elements, which include helium $(\ce{He})$, neon $(\ce{Ne})$, argon $(\ce{Ar})$, and so on, are called the *noble gases*. In sharp contrast, elements with seven electrons (one fewer than the maximum number of eight) in their outer energy level, such as fluorine $(\ce{F})$, chlorine $(\ce{Cl})$, and bromine $(\ce{Br})$, are highly reactive. They tend to gain the extra electron in their outer energy level. Elements with only one electron in their outer energy level, such as lithium $(\ce{Li})$, sodium $(\ce{Na})$, and potassium $(\ce{K})$, are also very reactive, but they tend to lose the single electron in their outer level.

The periodic table then leads to a useful generalization, the **octet rule**: Atoms tend to establish completely full outer energy levels. For the main group elements of the periodic table, the rule of eight is accomplished by one filled *s* orbital and three filled *p* orbitals.
(The exception to this is $\ce{He}$ which needs only two electrons to fill the 1*s* orbital). Most chemical behavior of biological interest can be predicted quite accurately from this simple rule, combined with the tendency of atoms to balance positive and negative charges. 

Of the $90$ Naturally occurring elements on earth, only 12:
$$
\ce{C,H,O,N,P,S,Na,K,Ca,Mg,Fe,Cl}
$$
Are found in living systems in more than trace amounts ($0.01\%$ or higher). These elements all have atomic numbers less than 21, and thus, have low atomic masses. Of these 12, the first 4 elements constitute $96\%$ of the weight of the human body. The majority of the molecules that make up a human body, other than water, are compounds of carbon, which are called *organic compounds*.
