# Atoms
Any substance in the universe that has mass and occupies space is defined as **matter**. All matter is composed of extremely small particles called **atoms**.

## Bohr Atomic model

The Bohr atomic model proposes that every atom is formed by a nuclei that has an orbiting cloud of *electrons* (similar to the solar system). This nucleus is formed by two other kind of subatomic particles: *neutrons* and *protons*. 

## Atomic number
Different atoms are defined by the number of protons, a quantity called *atomic number*. Atoms with the same atomic number (that is, the same number of protons) have the same chemical properties and are said to belong to the same element. Formally speaking, an *element* is any substance that cannot be broken down to any other substance by ordinary chemical means.
Within the nucleus, the cluster of protons and neutrons is held together by a force that works only over short, subatomic distances. Each proton carries a positive ($+$) charge, and each neutron has no charge. Each electron carries a negative ($-$) charge. 
Typically, an atom has one electron for each proton and is thus electrically neutral. The chemical behavior of an atom is due to the number and configuration of the electrons.

## Atomic mass 
The atomic mass of an atom is equal to the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons. The mass of subatomic particles is measured in *daltons*. 

$6.02\times10^{23}$ daltons $=1$**g**.  

This number is known as the [Avoggadro constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_constant)

# Electrons
The positive charges in the nucleus of an atom are neutralized, or counterbalanced, by negatively charged electrons, which are located in regions called **orbitals** that lie at varying distances around the nucleus. Atoms with the same number of protons and electrons are electrically neutral (that is, they have no net charge, and are therefore known as **neutral atoms**).
