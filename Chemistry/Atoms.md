Any substance in the universe that has mass and occupies space is defined as **matter**. All matter is composed of extremely small particles called **atoms**.

## Bohr Atomic model

The Bohr atomic model proposes that every atom is formed by a nuclei that has an orbiting cloud of *electrons* (similar to the solar system). This nucleus is formed by two other kind of subatomic particles: *neutrons* and *protons*. 

## Atomic number
Different atoms are defined by the number of protons, a quantity called *atomic number*. Atoms with the same atomic number (that is, the same number of protons) have the same chemical properties and are said to belong to the same element. Formally speaking, an *element* is any substance that cannot be broken down to any other substance by ordinary chemical means.
Within the nucleus, the cluster of protons and neutrons is held together by a force that works only over short, subatomic distances. Each proton carries a positive ($+$) charge, and each neutron has no charge. Each [[electrons|electron]] carries a negative ($-$) charge. 
Typically, an atom has one electron for each proton and is thus electrically neutral. The chemical behavior of an atom is due to the number and configuration of the electrons.

## Atomic mass 
The atomic mass of an atom is equal to the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons. The mass of subatomic particles is measured in *daltons*. 

$6.02\times10^{23}$ daltons $=1$**g**.  

This number is known as the [Avoggadro constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_constant)


# Isotopes
Although all atoms of an element have the same number of protons they may not all have the same number of neutrons. Atoms of a single element that posses different numbers of neutrons are called **isotopes** of that element.

Most elements in nature exist as mixtures of different isotopes. Carbon ($\ce{C}$), for example, has three isotopes, all containing six protons

Over $99\%$ of the carbon found in nature exists as an isotope that also contains six neutrons. Because the total mass of this isotope is $12$ daltons (6 protons and 6 Neutrons), it is referred to as Carbon-12 and is symbolized as: $\ce{^{12}C}$.

Most of the rest of the naturally occurring carbon is carbon-13, an isotope with seven neutrons. 

The rarest carbon isotope is carbon-14, with eight neutrons. The rarest carbon isotope is carbon-14, with eight neutrons. Unlike the other two isotopes, $\ce{^{14}C}$ is **unstable**: This means that its nucleus tends to break up into elements with lower atomic numbers. This nuclear breakup, which emits with lower atomic numbers. This nuclear breakup, which emits a significant amount of energy, is called radioactive decay, and isotopes that decay in this fashion are **radioactive isotopes**. For any same isotope the rate of decay is constant, expressed as *half-life*, the time it takes for one-half of the atoms in a sample to decay.
