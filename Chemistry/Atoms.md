Any substance in the universe that has mass and occupies space is defined as **matter**. All matter is composed of extremely small particles called **atoms**.

## Bohr Atomic model

The Bohr atomic model proposes that every atom is formed by a nuclei that has an orbiting cloud of *electrons* (similar to the solar system). This nucleus is formed by two other kind of subatomic particles: *neutrons* and *protons*. 

## Atomic number
Different atoms are defined by the number of protons, a quantity called *atomic number*. Atoms with the same atomic number (that is, the same number of protons) have the same chemical properties and are said to belong to the same element. Formally speaking, an *element* is any substance that cannot be broken down to any other substance by ordinary chemical means.
Within the nucleus, the cluster of protons and neutrons is held together by a force that works only over short, subatomic distances. Each proton carries a positive ($+$) charge, and each neutron has no charge. Each electron carries a negative ($-$) charge. 
Typically, an atom has one electron for each proton and is thus electrically neutral. The chemical behavior of an atom is due to the number and configuration of the electrons.

## Atomic mass 
The atomic mass of an atom is equal to the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons. The mass of subatomic particles is measured in *daltons*. 

$6.02\times10^{23}$ daltons $=1$**g**.  

This number is known as the [Avoggadro constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_constant)

# Electrons
The positive charges in the nucleus of an atom are neutralized, or counterbalanced, by negatively charged electrons, which are located in regions called **orbitals** that lie at varying distances around the nucleus. Atoms with the same number of protons and electrons are electrically neutral (that is, they have no net charge, and are therefore known as **neutral atoms**). 

Electrons are maintained in their orbitals by their attraction to the positively charged nucleus. Sometimes other forces overcome this attraction, and an atom loses one or more electrons. In other cases, atoms gain additional electrons.

An atom having more protons than electrons has a net positive charge and is called a **cation**. For example:
$$
\ce{Na->Na+}
$$
When $\ce{Na}$ loses an electron it becomes a sodium ion ($\ce{Na+}$), with a charge of $+1$. If otherwise it gains an electron it ends up with a  charge of -1 and it's called an **anion**
$$
\ce{Cl->Cl-}
$$

## Isotopes
Although all atoms of an element have the same number of protons they may not all have the same number of neutrons. Atoms of a single element that posses different numbers of neutrons are called **isotopes** of that element.

Most elements in nature exist as mixtures of different isotopes. Carbon ($\ce{C}$), for example, has three isotopes, all containing six protons

Over $99\%$ of the carbon found in nature exists as an isotope that also contains six neutrons. Because the total mass of this isotope is $12$ daltons (6 protons and 6 Neutrons), it is referred to as Carbon-12 and is symbolized as: $\ce{^{12}C}$.

Most of the rest of the naturally occurring carbon is carbon-13, an isotope with seven neutrons. 

The rarest carbon isotope is carbon-14, with eight neutrons. The rarest carbon isotope is carbon-14, with eight neutrons. Unlike the other two isotopes, $\ce{^{14}C}$ is **unstable**: This means that its nucleus tends to break up into elements with lower atomic numbers. This nuclear breakup, which emits with lower atomic numbers. This nuclear breakup, which emits a significant amount of energy, is called radioactive decay, and isotopes that decay in this fashion are **radioactive isotopes**. For any same isotope the rate of decay is constant, expressed as *half-life*, the time it takes for one-half of the atoms in a sample to decay. 

## Electrons determine the chemical behavior of atoms
The key to the chemical behavior of an atom lies in the number and arrangement of its electrons in their orbitals. The Bohr model of the atom shows individual electrons as following distinct circular orbits around a central nucleus.

**An orbital** is defined as the area around a nucleus where an electron is most likely to be found. These orbitals represent probability distributions for electrons.

## Atoms contain discrete energy levels
Because electrons are attracted to the positively charged nucleus, it takes work to keep them in their orbitals. Electrons have potential energy that is related to their position. To oppose the attraction of the nucleus and move the electron to a more distant orbital requires an input of energy, which results in an electron with greater potential energy. Moving an electron closer to the nucleus has the opposite effect: Energy is released, usually as radiant energy (heat or light), and the electron ends up with less potential energy.

These discrete energy levels correspond to quanta, which means specific amount of energy. Because the amount of energy an electron possesses is related to its distance from the nucleus, electrons that are the same distance from the nucleus have the same energy, even if they occupy different orbitals. Such electrons are said to occupy the same energy level. 
These energy levels are denoted with letters $K,L,M$ and so on.
