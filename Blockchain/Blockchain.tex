\section{Blockchain definition}
Blockchain is a list of records, called \textit{blocks}, that are securely linked together
using cryptograhpy. Each block contains a cryptograhpic hash of the previous block, a \textit{timestamp}
, and transaction data, generally represented as a \textit{Merkle tree}. The timestamp proves
that the transaction data existed when the block was published to get into its hash.

This structure allows for the datastructure to be immutable, and provides a linear forward history.
\section{Blockchain vs Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT)}
Blockchain is a type of DLT i.e. not all DLTs are blockchain.

A DLT is a decentralized database that is managed byvarious participants. There is no central
authority that acts as monitor. Similar to a blockchain.

The main difference between Blockchain and DLT is that a Blockchain shares its records via blocks
, cryptograhpically protected blocks, i. e. a specific application of a DLT.
