# Tokens
A token is a **digital asset** that can be securely stored on the blockchain.

Tokens can be anything, e.g.:
* Votes in election process
* Licenses to ownership of a song
* etc...

Tokens are **assets** or **access rights** and Tokens grant permission or ownership to a user

Tokens are:

* **not cryptocurrencies**
* crypto-assets, and not all cryptos are for payment purposes
* a **digital representation** of a physical or digital asset in a blockchain network

Cryptocurrencies are tokens, specifically, **fungible tokens** for payment, but not all tokens are cryptocurrencies.
Some tokens represent food or products to trace, voting rights, debt or they can also represent **non fungible tokens** such as real state or a piece of art (**NFTs**) 

* **Fungible**: Said of a good, that can be replaced by an identical item or mutually interchangeable

## Types of fungible tokens
There are mainly 3 types of fungible tokens:

1. **Payment tokens**: Used as means of exchange, that is for payment purposes 
2. **Utility tokens**: Digital coupons for a coming service or product
3. **Security tokens**: Equity or debt instruments, and they can be commercialized following the financial regulations set by each country. Security tokens are essentially *digital contracts* for fractions of any asset that already has value.
