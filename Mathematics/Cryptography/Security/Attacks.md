By looking at electrical current of a processor we can tell if at each step it multiplies or calculates the Square. In this case, we can find the exponent by:

1. Start with a $1$ as the exponent
2. If the signal received is a "Square", then add a 0 to the exponent
3. If the signal received is a "Multiply" swap the last 0 for a 1
