# Fundamental Security Principles

1. **Security depends on the resources of the attacker**: We say that a cryptographic scheme is secure if there are not efficient attacks
2. **Kerckhoffs' principle**: Design the your system so that it is secure even if the attacker knows all of its algorithms
3. **Security is impossible without randomness**

## Security Parameter

The way to achieve this is through a natural number that we call theÂ _security parameter_, usually denoted by $\lambda$. The information about both security and efficiency will be expressed in terms of the security parameter.
