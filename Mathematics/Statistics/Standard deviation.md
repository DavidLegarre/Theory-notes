# Standard deviation
Standard deviation (or $\sigma$) is a measure how dispersed the data is in respect to the [[Mean]].

Low $\sigma$ means that the data is clustered around the mean ($\mu$) and higher means its more spread. 

## Formula
Let $N$ be the size of the sample, and $X$ the set of elements of the sample
$$
\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{\sum\limits_{\forall i\in X}|x_{i}-\mu|Â²}{N}}
$$
