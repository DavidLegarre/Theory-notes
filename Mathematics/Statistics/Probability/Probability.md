# Probability

## Sample space and Events
The **sample space $\Omega$** is the set of possible outcomes of an experiment. Points $\omega\in\Omega$ are called **sample outcomes**. Subsets of $\Omega$ are called **events**.


# Conditional probability
Conditional probability is a measure of the probability of an event occurring, given that another event has already occurred, denoted by the symbol "$|$".
