# Functions
A **function** is a rule that assigns to each element $x$ in a set $D$ **exactly one element**, called $f(x)$, in a set $E$. 

Where, $D$ is called the **domain** of the function. The number $f(x)$ is the **value of $f$ at $x$** read as "$f$ of $x$", sometimes also called the **image** of the function

The **range** of $f$ is the set of all possible values of $f(x)$ as $x$ varies throughout the domain. 

* A symbol that represents an arbitrary number in the ***domain*** of a function $f$ is called an **independent variable**.
* A symbol that represents a number in the ***range*** of $f$ is called a **dependent variable**.

> **Vertical Line** test: A curve in the $xy$-plane is the graph of a function of $x$ if and only if no vertical line intersects the curve more than once

## Symmetry
If a function $f$ satisfies $f(-x)=f(x)$ for every number $x$ in its domain, then $f$ is called an **even function**. For instance, the function $f(x)=x^{2}$ is even because:
$$
f(-x)=(-x)^{2}=x^{2}=f(x)
$$
If, on the other hand, it satisfies that $f(-x)=-f(x)$, then it is called an **odd function**. For instance, the function $f(x)=x^{3}$ is odd:
$$
f(-x)=(-x)^{2}=-x^{3}=-f(x)
$$

## Function types

Let $X$ and $Y$ be finite sets. A functions $f\ :\ X\to Y$ is:

* **Injective**: If it maps distinct inputs to distinct outputs in 1-to-1 manner, then we have $|Y|\geq|X|$:$$ x\not=x'\to f(x)\not=f(x')$$

* **Surjective**: If for every element in $Y$ is a possible output of $f$, then we have $|Y|\leq|X|$. $$
  \forall\ y\in Y, \exists\ x\in X \quad f(x)=y$$

  **Bijective**: If $f$ is both injective and surjective, then we have $|X|=|Y|$.
