# Graph
A graph is a pair $G=(V,E)$, where $V$ is a set whose elements are called *vertices* (singular: *vertex*), and $E$ is a set of paired vertices, whose elements are called *edges*.

A graph with 3 edges and 3 vertices

## Vertices
The vertices $x$ and $y$ of an edge $\{x,y\}$ are called *endpoints* of the edge. The edge is is said to *join* $x$ and $y$ and to be *incident* on $x$ and $y$. A vertex may belong to no edge, in which case it is not joined to any other vertex.

## Cliques
A subset of of vertices of an [[Glossary of Graph Theory#Undirected|undirected]] graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are [[Glossary of Graph Theory#Adjacent|adjacent]].
