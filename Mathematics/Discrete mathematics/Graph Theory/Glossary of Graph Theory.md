# Glossary of Graph Theory
## Adjacent
Can refer to:
1. The relation between two distinct edges that share the an end vertex.
2. The relation between two vertices that are both endpoints of the same edge.

## Chord
Let $X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{k}$ be a loop in the graph. The, a **chord** in a loop is an edge connecting $X_{i},X_{j}$ for two non-consecutive nodes $X_{i}, X_{j}$.

## Cycle
A cycle may be either a kind of graph or a kind of walk. As a walk it may be either be a closed walk (also called a [tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory#tour)) or more usually a closed walk without repeated vertices and consequently edges (also called a simple cycle). In the latter case it is usually regarded as a graph, i.e., the choices of first vertex and direction are usually considered unimportant; that is, [cyclic permutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_permutation "Cyclic permutation") and reversals of the walk produce the same cycle. Important special types of cycle include [Hamiltonian cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_cycle "Hamiltonian cycle"), [induced cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_cycle "Induced cycle"), [peripheral cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_cycle "Peripheral cycle"), and the shortest cycle, which defines the [girth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girth_(graph_theory) "Girth (graph theory)") of a graph. A k-cycle is a cycle of length k; for instance a 2-cycle is a [digon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digon "Digon") and a 3-cycle is a triangle. A [cycle graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_graph "Cycle graph") is a graph that is itself a simple cycle; a cycle graph with n vertices is commonly denoted _C__n_.

## Undirected
An undirected graph is a graph in which the two endpoints of each edge are not distinguished from each other.
