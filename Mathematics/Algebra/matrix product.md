# Matrix product
In mathematics, **matrix multiplication** is **a binary operation that produces a [[matrix]] from two matrices**. For matrix multiplication, the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. The resulting matrix has the number of rows of the first and the number of columns of the second matrix
