# Higher dimensional fields
With $\mathbf{F}$ standing for either $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$:

$\mathbf{F}^{n}$  is the set of  all lists of length *n* of elements of $\mathbf{F}$:
$$
\mathbf{F}^{n}=\{(x_{1},\dots,x_{n}):x_{j}\in \mathbf{F} for\ j=1,\ldots,n\}
$$
We say that $x_j$ is the $j^{\text{th}}$ **coordinate** of $(x_{1},\dots, x_{n})$ 

## Examples

* The set $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ , which we can think as a plane, is the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers:
$$
\mathbb{R}^{2}=\{(x,y):x,y\in \mathbb{R}\}
$$
* The set $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, which we can think of as an ordinary 3D plane, is the set of all ordered triples of real numbers:
$$
\mathbb{R}^{3}=\{(x,y,z):x,y,z\in \mathbb{R}\}
$$

## Addition in fields
If $x,y\in \mathbb{F}^{n}$, then $x+y=y+x$

## Definition of $0$ 
Let $0$ denote the list of length $n$ whose coordinates are all $0$:
$$
0=(0,\ldots,0).
$$
