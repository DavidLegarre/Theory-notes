# Cloud Computing 

```ad-summary

The on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing

We can distinguish 3 deployment models for cloud computing:

## Cloud-based deployment
* **Run** all parts of the application in the **cloud**
* **Migrate** existing applications to the cloud
* Design and build new applications in the cloud

You can build these applications on low-level infrastructure that requires your IT staff to manage them. Alternatively, you can build them using higher-level services that reduce the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of the core infrastructure. 

## On-premises deployment
* Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools
* Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies

**On-premises** deployment, also known as a *private cloud* deployment. In this model, resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools. 

## Hybrid deployment
* Connect cloud-based resource to on-premises infrastructure
* Integrate cloud-base resources with legacy IT applications

In a hybrid deployment, cloud-based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure. You might want to use this approach in a number of situations. For example, you have legacy applications that are better maintained on premises, or government regulations require your business to keep certain records on premises.
