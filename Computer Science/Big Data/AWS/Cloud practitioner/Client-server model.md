# Client-server model

## Client
In computing, a **client** can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers. A **server** can be services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ([Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html)), a type of virtual server. 

The client makes a request to the server, and the server must validate that the conditions for the request are met and that the users has the required rights. 

# You only pay for what you need model
The model mainly used in the AWS platform. This means that, as user, you only pay for the resources you need them now.
