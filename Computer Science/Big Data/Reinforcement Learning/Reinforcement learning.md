# Reinforcement Learning
In reinforcement learning, a form of [[Machine Learning]], where the agent (computer) learns how to map situations (states) to actions. Then, by using this actions, it can maximize a numerical reward. The agent is not explicitly told which actions to take, but instead it must discover which actions yield the most reward through trial and error.
