Lists are created using square brackets:
```python
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

List items are ordered, changeable and allow duplicate values. List items are indexed, with `[0]` as the first index.

When we say lists are ordered, it means that the items inside a list have a defined order, and that order will not change, any new items added to the list will be added to the end of the list.

A list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created. 

List can be of **any** data type, and the same list can contain **different** data types:

```python
list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]  
list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]  
list3 = [True, False, False]
list4 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]
```
