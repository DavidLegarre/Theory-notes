## Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Techonologies (DLT)
Blockchain is a specific case of a DLT, in this case, the information is stored in blocks that form a chain.

Blockchain are based on

* ## [[Consensus protocol]]
* ## [[Smart contracts]]
* ## [[Tokens]]

The difference between Tokens and Smart contracts.
