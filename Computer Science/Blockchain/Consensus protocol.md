# Consensus protocol
The consensus protocol is the algorithmic procedure that run actions to resolve a specific purpose, **assigning a coordination to a problem** able to reach an agree for **a single  data-value** during computational process

Having an **agreement on the same value** offers protection from failing nodes or harmful users in the network.

A consensus protocol:
* A way to **automatize the decision-making**, using computational power and mathematical algorithms.
* allows to design a network where all records are synchronized, negotiating and setting that **one record is the correct one**. 
* can be defined as the state in which all network partners know the same state, or **when everyone agrees on the same state**.

The main advantage of a consensus protocol is that it must be:
* Difficult to solve
* Easy to verify

# Consensus models
## Definition
A state of the system in which every node arrives at the same result

## Requirements 
* Safety: Data is valid and interpreted the same between nodes
* Liveliness: A sent message is eventually delivered (In fixed time)

## Handle failure
There are many sources of failure, such as errors or people with malicious behavior.
