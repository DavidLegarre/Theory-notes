# Dot product
In mathematics, the **dot product** or **scalar product** is an algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (usually coordinate vectors), and returns a single number.

The dot product is defined with the symbol "$·$ ":
$$
a·b=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}b_i=a_{1}b_{1}+a_{2}b_{2}+\ldots+a_{n}b_{n}
$$
e.g.:

If the vectors are identified as row matrices, the dot product can also be written as a [[matrix product]] 
$$
a·b=ab^{\intercal}
$$
