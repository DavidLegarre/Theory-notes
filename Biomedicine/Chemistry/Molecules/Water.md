# Water

```ad-summary 
title:Defintion 

Water is an [[inorganic]], transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance with formula $\ce{H2O}$. Which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the [[fluids]] of all known living organisms

It satisfies the [[octet rule]], has no unpaired [[electrons]], and carries no net electrical charge. The 
electronegativity of $\ce{O}$ is much greater than that of $\ce{H}$, and so the bonds between these atoms are highly polar. *The polarity of water underlies water's chemistry and the chemistry of life*. 

The single most outstanding chemical property of water is its ability to form weak chemical bonds, called [[hydrogen bonds]]. These bonds form between the partially negative $\ce{O}$ atoms and 
the partially positive $\ce{H}$ atoms of two water molecules. Although these bonds have only 
$5-10\%$  of the strength of [[Covalent Bonds]], they are important to [[DNA]] and [[Protein]] structure.

## Cohesive

The [[Atoms#Polarity|polarity]] of water allows water molecules to be attracted to one another (that is, water is *cohesive*). The oxygen end of each water molecule, which is $\ce{\delta-}$, is attracted to the hydrogen end 
of each water molecule, which is $\ce{\delta+}$, of other molecules. The attraction produces hydrogen bonds among water molecules.

Water's cohesion is responsible for it being a [[liquid]], not a [[gas ]], at moderate temperatures. The 
cohesion of liquid water is also responsible for its [[surface tension]]. 

## Adhesive 
```ad-summary 
title:Defintion 

The [[Atoms#Polarity|polarity]] of water causes it to be attracted to other polar molecules as well. This attraction for other polar substances is called **adhesion**
```

Water adheres to any substance with which it can form
