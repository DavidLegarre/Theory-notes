# Chemical Bonds
connects to: [[Covalent Bonds]]

A group of atoms held together by energy in a stable association is called *molecule*. When a molecule contains atoms of more than one element, it is called a *compound*. We can differentiate 5 types of bonds between atoms (from strongest to weakest):

1.  [[Covalent Bonds]]: Sharing an electron
2. **Ionic Bond**: Attraction of opposite charges
3. **Hydrogen Bond**: Sharing of $\ce{H}$ atom
4. **Hydrophobic interaction**: Forcing of hydrophobic portions of molecules together in presence of polar substances 
5. **van der Waals attraction**: Weak attractions between atoms due to oppositely polarized electron clouds
