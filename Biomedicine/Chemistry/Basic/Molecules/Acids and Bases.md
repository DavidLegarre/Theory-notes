# Acids and Bases
```ad-summary 
title:Defintion 
The concentration of hydrogen ions, and concurrently of hydroxide ions, in a solution is described by the terms *acidty* and *basicity*.
```

## pH Scale
```ad-summary 
title:Defintion 
This scale defines *pH*, which stands for "**power of hydrogen**", as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration in the solution
$$
pH=-\log[\ce{H+}]
$$
```

Example:
	For pure water, with a concentration of $10^{-7}\ mol/L$, corresponds to a pH value of 7. 

The value $7$ is defined as the neutral point, a balance between $\ce{H+}$ and $\ce{OH-}$ concentrations, in the pH scale. 

```ad-tip 
title:Note 
Because pH is *logarithmic*, a difference of 1 in the scale represents a 10-fold change in the $\ce{H+}$ concentration.
```
