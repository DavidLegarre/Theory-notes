# Chemical reactions alter bonds

The formation and breaking of chemical bonds, which is the foundation of chemistry,
is termed a *chemical reaction*. All chemical reactions involve the shifting of atoms from one 
molecule or ionic compound to another, without the change in the number or identity of the 
atoms. For convenience, we refer to the original molecules before the reaction starts as 
*reactants*, and the molecules resulting from the chemical reaction as *products*. 

For example
$$
\ce{6H2O +6CO2->C6H12O6 +6O2}
$$

The extent to which chemical reactions occur is influenced by three important factors:

1. **Temperature**: Heating the reactants increases the rate of reaction because the reactant collide with one another more often. 
2. **Concentration of reactants and products**: Reactions proceed more quickly when more reactants are available, allowing more frequent collisions. An accumulation of products typically slows the reaction and, in reversible reactions, may speed the reaction in the reverse direction
3. **Catalysts**: A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a reaction. 

Many reactions in nature are **reversible**. This means that *the products may themselves be reactants*, allowing the reaction to proceed in reverse. We can write the preceding reaction in the reverse order: 
$$
\ce{C6H12O6 +6O2->6H2O +6CO2}
$$
This is a simplified version of the oxidation of [[Glucose]] by cellular respiration, in which glucose is broken down into water and carbon dioxide in the presence of oxygen. Virtually all organisms carry out forms of glucose oxidation.
