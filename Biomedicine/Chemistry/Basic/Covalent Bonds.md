Connects to: [[Atoms]], [[Periodic Table]]

*Covalent bonds* form when two atoms share one or more pairs of valence electrons. Consider gaseous hydrogen $(\ce{H2})$ as an example. 
Each hydrogen atom has an unpaired electron and an unfilled outer energy level; for these reasons, the hydrogen atom is unstable. However, when two hydrogen atoms are in close association, each atom's electron is attracted to both nuclei. In effect, the nuclei are able to share their electrons. The results is a diatomic molecule of hydrogen gas.
This molecule is stable for these 3 reasons:
* **It has no net charge**: The diatomic molecule formed as a result of this sharing of electrons is not charged because it still contains two protons and two electrons.
* **The octet rule is satisfied**: Each of the two hydrogen atoms can be considered to have two orbiting electrons in its outer energy level. This state satisfies the octet rule, because each shared electron orbits both nuclei and is included in the outer energy level of both atoms.
* **It has no unpaired electrons**: The bond between the two atoms also pairs the two free electrons.

The strength of a covalent bond depends on the number of shared electrons.

## Polar and nonpolar covalent bonds
Atoms differ in their affinity for electrons, a property called **electronegativity**. In general, electronegativity increases left to right across a row of the periodic table and decreases down the column

For bonds between two *identical* atoms, the electrons are equally shared. Such bonds are termed **nonpolar**. The resulting compound $\ce{H_2}$ or $\ce{O_2}$.

For [[Atoms]] that differ greatly in [[Electronegativity]], [[Electrons]] are not shared equally. The shared electrons are more likely to be closer to the atom of lower [[Electronegativity]]. This unequal distribution results in regions of partial negative charge near the more electronegative atom, and regions of partial positive charge near the less electronegative atom. Such bonds are termed **polar covalent bonds**.
